## An example
- [AI-Assisted Fake Porn Is Here and We’re All Fucked](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gydydm/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn)<br />
	Deepfakes told me he’s not a professional researcher, **just a programmer** with an interest in machine learning.
	“I just found a clever way to do face-swap,” he said, referring to his algorithm. “With hundreds of face images, I can easily generate millions of distorted images to train the network,” he said. “After that if I feed the network someone else's face, the network will think it's just another distorted image and try to make it look like the training face.”

## The future belong to programmers
1. Just download from Github and use it 
2. Many companys are working on automating the process
